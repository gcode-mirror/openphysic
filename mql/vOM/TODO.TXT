ToDo:
parameters management for each trades
(BreakEvenByOrder=false TrailingStopByOrder=true) )
default value

ToFix:
pb of global variables not deleted when unused

Set vSL and vTP in pips
	vOM_SL_dist
	vOM_TP_dist

vOM_SL shouldn't ask for ticket if there is only 1 order in basket

GUI Is it necessary to use inputbox ?
other ways
	1)script with extern variable (need to define property)
		#property show_inputs
	2)real GUI in MT4
	3)prog outside of MT4 (what bridge ?)
